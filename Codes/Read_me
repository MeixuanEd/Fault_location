## Instructions of running the codes:
1, The title illustrate the function of the codes (whether training or testing, which kind of classifier used like CNN, or NN or MSVM);

2, For the 'Training_*' codes, you can train the model based on different measured bus. The notation of the measured bus is in vector "w". 
   You can also select the buses according to the degree, i.e., by setting "thres_degree", the buses with larger degree will be selected;
   
3, For the 'Testing_*' codes, you can choose the fault types in the 'main()' function, 
   for example, setting the "fault_type =1" by # 0--Tp;1--LG; 2--LLG; 3--LL 
   
4, You can also select different saved models by choose the name "model_name",
  for example, "model_name ='./best_model_20_bus/Locate_u_feature4' " means to select the best model if only 20 buses are measured. 
  (Notice that the saved model called 'Locate_u_feature4' is in the corresponding folder "./best_model_20_bus", and you can find other
  saved models from 11 buses to 20 buses, but remember if you choose the model measured on different buses, please also change the bus
  notations "w" to the corresponding number of buses. 
  The 20 best buses selected is "w= [0,  8, 15, 29, 35, 22, 41 , 60, 50, 56, 5,36,57,44, 25,9, 32,3,40,7]"
  
5, If the fault type is selcted, then the output is the locatio accuracy of this kinds of faults with 4 different fault impedance and 
  their mean: 
  like [[0.98591548]
       [0.95774651]
       [0.98591548]
       [0.91549295]]
        Mean is96.13
